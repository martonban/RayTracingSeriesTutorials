# [WIP] RayTracingSeries
This Repository is goning to contain the code of the "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", "Ray Tracing in The Next Week" and the "Ray Tracing: The Rest of Your Life" 
<br>


# Getting Started
## Ray Tracing in One Weekend 
### 1) Clone 
Find a nice place for this project and clone it with 
```
git clone https://github.com/martonban/RayTracingSeriesTutorials.git
```

### 2) Build the project
For this project I used the build-in compiler of the Visual Studio 2022. I suggesting you to just build the whole solution with ```Ctrl+Shift+B```. 

### 3) Locate the executable
Your build path can be different than mine. It depends of your compiler setting. In my case:
```
cd One Weekend\x64\Debug
```
or if you used Release mode just cd to 
```
cd One Weekend\x64\Release
```

### 4) Render
```
RayTracingOneWeekend.exe > image.ppm
```
**Note!** The renderer will create a ```.ppm``` file next to the .exe.
